# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# You can also use email addresses if you prefer.
# Order is important. The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
# So if a pull request only touches javascript files, only these owners
# will be requested to review.
# (The line below should stay commented.)
# *.js   @octocat @github/js

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repo.
